# GraphQL Client Compiler

This project is an attempt to bring similar functionality to GraphQL that
exists with the Protocol Buffer compiler `protoc`.  The goal is to create an 
ecosystem of GraphQL client SDKs that can be generated from a schema file.

## Usage

`graphc schema.graphql --ts_out=$DST_DIR`

## Client Design Philosophy

The clients generated by this project are intentionally simple and easy to use.
Each client should create RPC style interfaces for the client developer that removes the
need to understand the syntax of GraphQL queries.  The reasons for this are:

 * Easier to get up an running quickly
 * Removes the need to regenerate types based on a DSL whenever you add or modify queries
 * Reduces the bundle size

## Example workflow

 1. Create your GraphQL schema (i.e., `schema.graphql`)
 2. Compile your client library code.
 3. Run your queries and mutations.
 4. Profit.

Example typescript client usage:

```typescript

import { queryUsers } from "./client.ts";

const users = await queryUsers({sort: "-createdAt", selections: {
    name:true, id: true, groups: {id: true, name: true}
    }
})
```
